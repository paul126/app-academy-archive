        The Airedale Terrier, the "King of Terriers," is brimming with
        personality. He has the trademark terrier temperament: energetic,
        curious, feisty, and boisterous. He thinks he is a comedian and will
        provide you with years of comic relief. He craves your attention and
        will act out to get it. They are intelligent, and quick learners, but
        they certainly think for themselves, so their idea of "trained" might
        differ from yours.

        their stable and reliable temperaments. Labs are good-natured and
        trustworthy. They're dependable and easy-going. Labs are very stable,
        they aren't easily upset or startled. They're eager to please you;
        always seeking your approval. Labs are very affectionate with their
        families and desire plenty of close physical contact: tummy rubs and
        behind the ears scratches. They thrive on human companionship and
        attention. They  always want to be with you and will follow you around
        everywhere you go!

        The Shiba Inu is a unique breed. Intelligent, active, energetic, they
        think pretty highly of themselves. They are famous for their spirited
        boldness and independent nature. If you are not careful, they will
        train you. Early obedience training is important, but even then, Shibas
        don't really enjoy being obedient. Off leash work is especially
        challenging and the recall might require a miracle. They love to run
        and they love to run away. They are escape artists and owners must be
        careful every single time they open a door because they will bolt. Some
        can even climb chain link fences. Shibas have been known to disappear
        for days at a time. They will hunt mice, squirrels, and other small
        animals if they can.
